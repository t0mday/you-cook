This project is a React App, using Redux Store.
It uses the Recipe Search API from Edamam https://www.edamam.com

It allows online recipes to be searched using keywords and allows for options to be selected for dietary restrictions and cuisine types. 

Recipe search results can be saved to a favourites section and further details for each recipe can be viewed, and it is possible to view the original recipe webpage in a new browser tab.
